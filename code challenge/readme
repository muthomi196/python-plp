Usage
To use the script, simply run it and enter the base and exponent values when prompted. The script will then print whether the result is greater than 5000 or not.

Example
Suppose you want to check whether 2 raised to the power of 10 is greater than 5000. Here's how you can use the script:

Save the script to a file named power_checker.py.
Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the file is saved.
Run the script by typing python power_checker.py.
Enter the base value (2) when prompted.
Enter the exponent value (10) when prompted.
The script will print "2 raised to the power of 10 is greater than 5000."
Code Structure
The script contains two functions:

large_power(base, exponent): This function calculates the result of raising the base to the power of exponent and returns True if the result is greater than 5000, and False otherwise.
main(): This function contains the main logic of the script. It requests the user to input the base and exponent values, converts them to integers, and passes them to the large_power function. Finally, it prints the result of the function.
The script also includes a check for __name__ to ensure that the main function is only called when the script is run directly. This is a common idiom in Python that allows the script to be imported as a module in other scripts without executing the main function.
